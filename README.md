## The first revelation:
In a garden, after a normal brownie, I instinctively felt the existence of God, more clearly than ever.
Why don't I feel warmth then, I asked myself. Why is life so hard then, I asked myself. Why is it so complicated then, to make the world just, I asked myself. A rationale so irrefutable and utterly conclusive came over me: God is a bitch! Not evil, just a bitch. She doesn't care at all about me, about us, and about you. I cursed her in my heart, as I had done so many times before, in desperate moments. I cursed her with all my hatred and spit on her creation with disgust, that she might strike me down. But nothing happened, it was as always: all good and all suffering came from myself and from the world, which flows in itself. And so then I also knew that everything I do, whether infinitely good or abysmally evil, is and will be completely indifferent to her. There are no rules. At least not from her. All the rules are of our own making.
